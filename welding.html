		<h1>My First Hands-On Introductions to Welding</h1>
		<p>
			My very first experience performing any form of hands-on welding was at a Boy Scout summer camp in my youth. The instruction was as a part of the welding merit badge, and it mostly focused on a surface-level understanding of welding safety, terminology, pros/cons of different welding processes, and welding career opportunities. I was also instructed on how to MIG weld a small project&mdash;a decorative Eagle from a kit. Since I was entirely inexperienced and was not provided with much opportunity to practice beforehand, my welds at the time were quite porous and only suitable for its use as a low-strength art piece. Despite this, I had a great deal of fun earning the welding merit badge and wanted to continue to learn.

		<h1>Bright College Days</h1>
		<p>
			<a href="https://case.edu/" target="_blank">Case Western Reserve University</a> is home to the largest open-access makerspace in the United States: <a href="https://case.edu/thinkbox/" target="_blank">Sears think[box]</a>. In addition to my engineering studies, one of my goals at school was to use the resources available to me at think[box] to learn about different manufacturing processes. Especially with my involvement with the school's SAE Baja Team <a href="https://cwrumotorsports.com/" target="_blank">CWRU Motorsports</a> (read more about that <a href="portfolio.html#baja">here</a>), I was able to learn how to use milling machines, lathes, and how to TIG weld steel and aluminum.
